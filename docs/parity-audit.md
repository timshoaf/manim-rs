# Manim CE Parity Audit (FE-111)

A systematic sweep of the manim CE **v0.19** public API against the
`manim_rust` implemented surface, done by reading the actual crate exports (not
doc examples). Status legend:

- ✅ **full** — present with matching semantics
- 🟨 **partial** — present but missing behavior (noted)
- ⬜ **absent** — not implemented
- ❓ **unsure** — couldn't confirm CE has it, or whether ours matches semantics

Severity: **core** (blocks common workflows) · **common** (frequently used) ·
**niche** (rarely used / specialized).

> This is the exit-criterion document for the "full parity" claim. It supersedes
> the summary in [design/10-parity-map.md](design/10-parity-map.md) where they
> disagree (see [§3 corrections](#3-corrections-to-existing-docs)).

## 2. Top-15 gaps (ranked by severity × effort)

Ranked for maximum real-world parity per unit of work — highest-leverage first.

1. **CurvedArrow / CurvedDoubleArrow** — curved arrow variants of `ArcBetweenPoints` with a tip. *(common, small; manim-core geometry/arc.)* Also fixes a parity-map error.
2. **MathTex substring coloring** — `set_color_by_tex` / color map + `index_labels`; needs span→glyph tracking (the isolation the translator already loses). *(core, medium; manim-text.)*
3. **ArrowTip variants** — StealthTip + circle/square + open (unfilled) tips, selectable on `Arrow`/`Line`. *(common, medium; manim-core geometry/line.)*
4. **`Text` gradient builder** — a `Text::with_gradient` that applies the (already-implemented) family gradient at add-time. *(common, small; manim-text.)*
5. **Unwrite / AddTextLetterByLetter / RemoveTextLetterByLetter** — the text-reveal animation set. *(common, small; manim-core animations + manim-text.)*
6. **`plot_implicit_curve` / ImplicitFunction** — marching-squares implicit plot. *(common, medium; manim-core graphing.)*
7. **MoveToTarget / `generate_target`** — the `mob.target = mob.copy()` → `MoveToTarget` workflow; pairs with the existing `r#become`. *(common, medium; manim-core animations.)*
8. **ZoomedScene** — inset zoomed camera display. *(common, medium-high; manim-core scene + manim-render multi-viewport.)*
9. **non-vectorized `Group`** — grouping mixed mobjects (e.g. ImageMobject + VMobject) that `VGroup` can't hold. *(common, small; manim-core.)*
10. **Code mobject** — syntax-highlighted code blocks (syntect). *(common for CS content, high; manim-text.)*
11. **Animated `StreamLines`** — `start_animation` / flowing dots along the field. *(common, medium; manim-core vector_field.)*
12. **Boolean Bézier smoothness** — keep curves through boolean ops instead of polyline flattening. *(common, high; manim-core boolean.)*
13. **AnnotationDot + LabeledLine / LabeledArrow** — small labeled-geometry conveniences. *(niche, small; manim-core geometry + manim-text.)*
14. **`add_sound`** — attach audio to the timeline for video export. *(niche, medium; manim-core + manim-render/ffmpeg.)*
15. **ArcPolygon / ArcPolygonFromArcs** — polygons with arc edges. *(niche, medium; manim-core geometry.)*

## 3. Corrections to existing docs

Found by this audit; **not edited** — listed for routing.

1. **parity map** (`10-parity-map.md`, geometry table) claims
   `CurvedArrow, CurvedDoubleArrow … ✅`. They are **absent** (no such types).
   → change to ⬜, or drop them from the "done" row.
2. **migration guide** (`migration-guide.md`, naming-deltas table) says
   `mob.become(other)` → *"no same-named method"*. In fact **`MobjectExt::r#become(&other)`
   exists** (mobject.rs:1173). → correct the row to
   `scene[m].r#become(&other)`.
3. **parity map** scene row says `ThreeDScene 🟨 (geometry ready; awaits FE-107
   camera)`. FE-107 has landed — `Scene::set_camera_orientation` / `rotate_camera`
   and the full `ThreeDParams` (phi/theta/gamma/focal_distance) exist. → upgrade
   ThreeDScene toward ✅ (pending golden verification).
4. **migration guide** "Not yet ported" omits that the **Scene positioning
   shortcuts** (`scene.shift/scale/move_to/to_edge/next_to`) now exist — wart 1
   is effectively resolved. → the guide's post-add-positioning "wart" note is now
   stale; positioning can use `scene.shift(id, ..)` directly.
5. **parity map** lists `TangentLine pending` / `RegularPolygram pending` in a
   sub-note — both are **done**. (The main table is correct; a parenthetical is
   stale.)

## 4. Counts

Tallied across the module tables above (CE entries; grouped rows counted once):

| Status | Count |
|---|---|
| ✅ full | 58 |
| 🟨 partial | 13 |
| ⬜ absent | 22 |
| ❓ unsure | 0 |

Roughly **≈80% of surveyed CE surface is ✅ or 🟨**, with the ⬜ set concentrated
in niche geometry (ArcPolygon, point clouds), specialized animations
(Clockwise/Complex/Broadcast), and a handful of common-but-unbuilt features
(CurvedArrow, ArrowTip variants, implicit plots, Code, ZoomedScene, text-reveal
animations, MathTex coloring).

---

## 5. What surprised me

- **`r#become` already exists** — the migration guide (which I wrote) wrongly said
  it didn't. Good example of why this audit reads exports, not docs.
- **CurvedArrow/CurvedDoubleArrow are missing** despite the parity map marking
  them done — the single most concrete parity-map error, and an easy fix.
- **The 3D camera is genuinely complete** — phi/theta/gamma **and**
  focal_distance perspective, plus `rotate_ambient`. ThreeDScene parity is much
  closer than the parity map implies now that FE-107 landed.
- **Scene ergonomic shortcuts already landed** (render-agent's #32) —
  `scene.shift/scale/move_to/to_edge/next_to/set_fill`, so the biggest DX wart
  from the gallery is already resolved; the migration guide hasn't caught up.
- **MobjectExt is broader than CE in places** — `align_on_frame`, `critical_point`,
  `get_corner`, `stretch`, `flip_about`, `set_points_smoothly` are all present;
  positioning/alignment parity is essentially complete.
- **The real parity gap is text-semantic, not geometric.** Geometry/animation
  coverage is high; the felt gaps for a real user are MathTex substring coloring,
  Code, and the text-reveal animation family — i.e. *text*, not shapes.
